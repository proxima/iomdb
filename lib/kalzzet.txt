G:
Deep within the foul dark lair
where plenty evils lurk.
Ugly with blood stained hair
you shalt not pass the murk.
From whence they came you shall not see
for fate will blind your toil.
Lord Jesrael makes the mighty flee
and all to return to soil.
But alas you are in vain
for ye arnt the one who sings.
Many will fail and be in pain
for salvation rides on dragon's wings.
R:
Ye find the lair where death awaits
and fight the awful smellm
But demons will ensure your fates
and send you straight to hell.
The fires burn and sear the flesh
of all who try to pass.
Yet struggle on through the mesh
is really quite a farse.
In the end the brave will fall 
and the mighty left to feast.
For inside the demons hall
you must slay the beast.
Y:
It is scribed on the wall
that the islands are doomed.
Ye shall await the invading to fall
whilst this evil doth hover and loom.
Islands fate is bleak and looking thin
as is tradition for fools.
When the forces arrive let the carnage begin
for the crimson rivers shall pool.
When all is lost and only despair
a lone hero will rise to the top.
Seek out the foe and right the unfairs
but will he be able to stop.
B:
In the centre lies the gate
but opening it sure to vex.
Many are the guards who wait
as you go to the middle hex.
Randomly sent to find a way
back to a different oaken door
A seventh time and you may stay
and seek the glowing prize no more.
You have won evil Jesrael's prize
his hoard cache of magic.
And free the one with yearning eyes
whose lot was hunger tragic.
